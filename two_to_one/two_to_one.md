# Two To One

# Problem

- Input: Two strings, `str1` and `str2`
- Output: A singular string containing all distinct letters from both strings,
in sorted order

# Example

# Algorithm

## Sort later

Given `str1` and `str2`:
- Initialize a rune slice to store characters
- Iterate over the strings, adding non-duplicates (includes?)
- Sort the rune slice
- Join the sorted slice & return
